In this lab I used Linksys by cisco to secure a cisco router
To do this first you must click the "wireless" tab

As you can see, everything is default.
It is reccommended to change default settings if your intentions are to boost security.

In the next page after clicking "WPA2 Enterprise" You get the option to configure an IP address and a Password.
Here you can see what I configured to add security.
